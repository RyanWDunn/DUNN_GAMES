Known Bugs:
	Debugger throws error in a godot cpp file when setting the velocity
		vector to a value in player.gd.  After extensive testing I 
		think this is a Godot Engine bug and will not affect gameplay
		but keeping an eye on this.
	On Save the output throws a bug about an out of bounds _p_frame.  I 
		believe I've fixed this but the error persists.  Watching it.
